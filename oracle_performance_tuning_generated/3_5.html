<h3>Concurrency on memory, latches: insufficient cached sequences from DBA_Sequences</h3>
Fetching of sequence values / filling the sequence cache causes writes in dictionary and interchange between REC-instances.<br/>
                          Highly frequent access on dictionary structures of sequences leads to unnecessary wait events, therefore you should define reasonable cache sizes for sequences.<br/>
                          Starting with Rel. 19.10 the DYNAMIC SEQUENCE CACHE feature will automatically cover this issue if you set the cache size of a sequence > 0.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT Sequence_Owner, Sequence_Name, Cache_size,
