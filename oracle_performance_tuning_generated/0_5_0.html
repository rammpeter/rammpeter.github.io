<h3>Orphaned materialized view logs</h3>
Materialized view logs may grow unlimited under several conditions:<br/>
1. There is no materialized view registered at this MV-log that consumes the recorded changes<br/>
2. There is one or more materialized view registered which does not consume the recorded changes by executing MV-refresh<br/>
3. There are only fragments remaining from MV registration in DBA_Snapshot_Logs (sys.slog$) but no registered MV in DBA_Registered_MViews (sys.reg_snap$)<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the reason there are several solutions to fix this issue:<br/>
1. Drop the useless MV-log by issuing DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON <master table><br/>
2. Unregister the not responding MV by calling DMBS_MVIEW.UNREGISTER_MVIEW<br/>
3. Remove the orphaned snapshot log by issuing DBMS_MVIEW.Purge_Log or DELETE FROM sys.slog$ WHERE SnapID = x<br/>
<br/>
DBMS_MVIEW.Purge_Log removes the MV Log-Records of the oldest (regarding last refresh) registered MViews und decouples the registered MView from the MV-Log.<br/>
So no MV Log records are kept for this MView in the future until next complete refresh restores complete registration at MV log.<br/>
