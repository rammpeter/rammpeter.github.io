<h3>Possibly missing NOT NULL constraint, although there are no NULL values in column</h3>
If a column is always filled with values, it should eventually be backed up by a NOT NULL constraint.<br/>
This is especially important if the column is indexed, since without the NOT NULL constraint the index is not used for an ORDER BY (or only if in the SQL result explicitly excludes NULLs).<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>
