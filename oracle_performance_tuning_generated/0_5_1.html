<h3>Registered materialized views without relation to MV-log</h3>
Registered materialized views with Can_Use_Log != 'NO' should have a relation to one or more materialized view logs via DBA_Snapshot_Logs, espeacially if they are fast refreshable.<br/>
Missing of this relation can be a hint for orphaned registrations of MVs.<br/>
<br/>
Possible solutions to fix this issue is deregistration of MV by calling DMBS_MVIEW.UNREGISTER_MVIEW<br/>
