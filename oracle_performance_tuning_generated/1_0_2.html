<h3>Full table scans  with small cardinality: possibly missing indexes </h3>
Access by full table scan is critical if only small parts of table are relevant for selection, otherwise are adequate for processing of whole table data.<br/>
They are out of place for OLTP-like access (small access time, many executions).<br/>
Placing an index may reduce runtime significant.<br/>
Calculated by high runtime of full scan and small expected number of records from full scan (by optimizer's cardinality).<br/>
This selection requires usage of AWR history with Diagnostics Pack.<br/>
