<h3>Detection of indexes with multiple indexed columns</h3>
This selection looks for indexes where one index indexes a subset of the columns of the other index, both starting with the same columns.<br/>
The purpose of the index with the smaller column set can regularly be covered by the second index with the larger column set (including protection of foreign key constraints).<br/>
So the first index often can be dropped without loss of function.<br/>
The effect of less indexes to maintain and less objects in database cache with better cache hit rate for the remaining objects in cache is mostly higher rated than the possible overhead of using range scan on index with larger column set.<br/>
<br/>
If the index with the smaller column set ensures uniqueness, then an unique constraint with this column set based on the second index with the larger column set can also cover this task.<br/>
