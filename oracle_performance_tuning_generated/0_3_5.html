<h3>Recommendations for automatic LIST partitioning</h3>
Automatic list partitiong (available from Rel. 12.2) is an easy way to reduce the data amount for full table scans with low effort and tiny impact.<br/>
This selection shows table or index access by SQL with filtering by columns with strong selectivity ordered by the runtime of the operation.<br/>
You may choose auto list partitioning for this tables if the low and stable number of distinct values for this filter columns allows to have the same number of partitions.<br/>
Multiple columns can be combined as partition keys, so often there is no need for subpartitioning in this case.<br/>
Auto list partitioning helps to:<br/>
- reduce the amount of processed DB blocks at full table scan<br/>
- remove indexes on potential partition key columns<br/>
- reduce index columns by potential partition key columns as leading columns (combined with LOCAL partitioning of this indexes)<br/>
