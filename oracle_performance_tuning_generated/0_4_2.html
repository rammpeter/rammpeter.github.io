<h3>Tables without write access (DML) since last analysis</h3>
Tables without any access by insert/update/delete/truncate or drop partition since last analysis.<br/>
For master data this behaviour may be default, but for transaction data this may be a hint that this table are not used no more and therefore possibly may be deleted.<br/>
For valid function of this selection table analysis should only be done if there has been DML on this table (stale-analysis).<br/>
