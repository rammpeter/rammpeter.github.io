<h3>Excessive logon operations (by current gv$Session)</h3>
An excessive number of logon operations may cause significant CPU-usage and possibly write I/O (e.g. for auditing).<br/>
It also slows down the application waiting for the connect.<br/>
Alternative solutions are usage of session pools, prevent subsequent LOGON/LOGOFF operations in loops.<br/>
This selection shows sessions that were created shortly before.<br/>
