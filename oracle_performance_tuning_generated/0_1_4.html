<h3>Detection of indexes without MONITORING USAGE</h3>
It is recommended to let the DB track usage of indexes by ALTER INDEX ... MONITORING USAGE<br/>
so you may identify indexes that are never used for direct index access from SQL.<br/>
This usage info should be refreshed from time to time to recognize also indexes that aren't used anymore.<br/>
How to and scripts for activating MONITORING USAGE may be found here:<br/>

<br/>
Index usage can be evaluated then via v$Object_Usage or with previous selection.<br/>
