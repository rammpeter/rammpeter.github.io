<h3>Missing usage of bind variables: Detection by identical plan-hash-value from Active Session History (SGA and AWR)</h3>
Usage of literals instead of bind variables with high number of different literals leads to high parse counts and flooding of SQL-Area in SGA.<br/>
You may reduce the problem by setting cursor_sharing != EXACT, but you still need large amount of SGA-memory to match your SQL with the corresponding SQL with replaced bind variables.<br/>
So strong suggestion is: Use bind variables!<br/>
This selection looks for statements with identical execution plans by plan-hash-value from Active Session History.<br/>
Using force-matching-signature instead of plan-hash-value for detection is risky because ASH often samples inaccurate values for force-matching-signature.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>WITH Ret AS (SELECT :P1 Days FROM DUAL)
