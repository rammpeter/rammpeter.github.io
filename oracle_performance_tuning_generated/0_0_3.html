<h3>Recommendations for index-compression, test by selectivity of single columns from multicolumn index</h3>
For multicolumn-indexes compression of single index columns (beginning from left) may be useful even if this multicolumn-index has overall Num_Rows=Distinct_Keys (selectivity=1).<br/>
Partial index-compression (COMPRESS x or COMPRESS ADVANCED LOW) assumes that index-column to be compressed has position 1 in index or all columns before are also compressed.<br/>
This selections shows recommendations for compression of single columns of multicolumn indexes beginning with column-position 1.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>WITH Indexes AS (SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE MATERIALIZE */ Owner, Table_Owner, Table_Name, Index_Name, Compression, Prefix_Length,
