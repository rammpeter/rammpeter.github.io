<h3>Statements with planned parallel execution forced to serial</h3>
PX COORDINATOR FORCED SERIAL in execution plan shows that optimizer assumed to process in parallel but detects reasons that prevents parallel execution (e.g. stored functions without PARALLEL_ENABLE).<br/>
The operations below that execution plan line are not really executed in parallel although the optimizer has marked them for parallel execution!<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT /* DB-Tools Ramm FORCE SERIAL in PQ */ x.* ,
