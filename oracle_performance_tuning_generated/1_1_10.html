<h3>Possible elimination of HASH JOIN BUFFERED by Parallel Shared Hash Join</h3>
Since release 18c there's an undocumented feature Parallel Shared Hash Join which introduces sharing memory between parallel query slaves.<br/>
The needed memory is allocated in the new memory region MGA (Managed Global Area).<br/>
Especially expensive HASH JOIN BUFFERED operations with spilling a lot of data into temporary tablespace can be transformed to HASH JOIN SHARED with much less memory requirements and thus improved runtime.<br/>
This selection shows SQLs with HASH JOIN BUFFERED in the DB history ordered by the runtime they consume for this particular operation.<br/>
<br/>
There are several ways to activate the Parallel Shared Hash Join:<br/>
- set '_px_shared_hash_join'=true; at system or session level<br/>
- define the PQ distribution strategy for a particular table in SQL by hint /*+ PQ_DISTRIBUTE(<table alias> SHARED NONE) */<br/>
- set '_px_shared_hash_join'=true; at SQL level by hint /*+ OPT_PARAM('_px_shared_hash_join' 'true') */<br/>
The latter option by OPT_PARAM fits best for me because behaviour can be controlled at SQL level without defining each table.<br/>
<br/>
If this transformation works, then the HASH JOIN BUFFERED turns into HASH JOIN SHARED in the execution plan.<br/>
<br/>
Respecting the unofficial state of this feature it should not be used in RAC environment if PQ operations are spread over several instances (parallel_force_local=FALSE).<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Randolf Eberle-Geist, who shared backgrounds of this feature.<br/>
