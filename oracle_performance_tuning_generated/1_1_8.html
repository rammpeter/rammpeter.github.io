<h3>Problematic usage of parallel query for short running SQLs (Current SGA)</h3>
For short running SQL the effort for starting parallel query processes is often higher than for excuting the SQL iteself.<br/>
Additional problems may be caused by the limited amount of PQ-processes for frequently executed SQLs<br/>
as well as by the basically recording of SQL Monitor reports for each PQ execution.<br/>
Therfore for SQLs with runtime in seconds or less you should always avoid using parallel query.<br/>
