<h3>Recommendations for possibly useful OLTP-compression of tables</h3>
Table compression (COMPRESS FOR xxx) reduces I/O-effort by improvement of cache hit ratio.<br/>
Decrease in size by 1/3 to 1/2 is possible.<br/>
Min. 20% decrease of size and relevant I/O should exist to compensate CPU overhead of compression/decompression.<br/>
<br/>
OLTP-compression is well suitable for tables with insert and delete operations.<br/>
During update operations DB-blocks are decompressed with possibly creation of chained rows. Therefore for OLTP-compression there should by only less or no update operations on table.<br/>
<br/>
OLTP-compression requires licensing of Advanced Compression Option.<br/>
