<h3>Non validated foreign key constraints</h3>
Non validated foreign key constraints prevent the usage of some optimizer features like JOIN ELIMINATION.<br/>
For full availability of all optimizer features foreign key constraints should be regularly validated.<br/>
<br/>
Missing validation can be effectively made up by temporary setting parallel degree for table:<br/>
ALTER TABLE <tab> PARALLEL x;<br/>
ALTER TABLE <tab> MODIFY CONSTRAINT <constraint> VALIDATE;<br/>
ALTER TABLE <tab> NOPARALLEL;<br/>
