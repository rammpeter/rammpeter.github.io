<h3>Possible violations of DETERMINISTIC declared functions that are used in function-based indexes</h3>
The functions used in function-based indexes should be declared as DETERMINISTIC.<br/>
If this functions are depending on tables, there could be a risk that the function result depends on a SQL result and this way the deterministic state could not be ensured.<br/>
This selection checks only indexes depending on functions and not on package functions because of the high probability of false positives.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT id.Owner Index_Owner, id.Name Index_Name, id.Referenced_Owner Function_Owner, id.Referenced_Name Function_Name,

JOIN   DBA_Dependencies fd ON fd.Owner = id.Referenced_Owner AND fd.Name = id.Referenced_Name
