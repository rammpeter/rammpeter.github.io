<h3>Write access by executions (current SGA)</h3>
Delays during log buffer write by log writer lead to „log file sync“ wait events, especially during commit.<br/>
Writing operations (Insert/Update/Delete) which cannot write into log buffer during „log file sync“ lead to „log buffer space“ wait events.<br/>
Requests for block transfer in RAC environment lead to „gc buffer busy“ wait events, if requested blocks in delivering RAC-instance are affected by simultaneous „log buffer space“ or „log file sync“ events.<br/>
The likelihood of „log buffer space“ events depends from frequency of writing operations. This selection determines heavy frequented write SQLs as candidates for deeper consideration.<br/>
Solution can be the aggregation of multiple writes (bulk-processing).<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT /* DB-Tools Ramm: Schreibende Zugriffe nach Executes */
