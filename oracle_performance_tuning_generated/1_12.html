<h3>Possibly unnecessary scan of all partitions of a partitioned table or index</h3>
This selection shows SQLs which access all partitions of a partitioned table or index,<br/>
but within the same or a close line of the execution plan the partition key is used as filter.<br/>
Often this is a sign of missed partition pruning, e.g. due to a conversion function around the partition key.<br/>
If, on the other hand, the partition key could be directly used as filter, the optimizer should be able to prune partitions and access only the relevant partitions.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>WITH Plans AS (SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE MATERIALIZE */ ID, SQL_ID, Plan_Hash_Value, Object_Owner, Object_Name, Object_Alias,
