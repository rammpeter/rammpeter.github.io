<h3>Cascading views (views with dependency from other views)</h3>
Views with dependencies from other views (possibly with multilevel dependency hierarchy) have the risk<br/>
to select data from unnecessesary objects which are not relevant for executing SQL statement.<br/>
This way the optimizer is not able to detect irrelevant parts of view neither to remove this parts from execution plan.<br/>
Sensible architecture pattern is, to use views only in one dimension without further dependencies from other views.<br/>
