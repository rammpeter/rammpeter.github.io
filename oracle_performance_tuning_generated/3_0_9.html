<h3>Problems with function based index if cursor_sharing != EXACT</h3>
If setting parameter cursor_sharing=FORCE or SIMILAR at session or instance level function based indexes with literals may not be considered for use,<br/>
because this literals become replaced by bind variables.<br/>
Solution: Transfer literals into PL/SQL-functions and call this function in function based index instead.<br/>
This view selects potential hits for function based indexes no more used for SQL execution.<br/>
