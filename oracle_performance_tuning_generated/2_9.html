<h3>Active sessions (from AWR history DBA_Hist_Active_Sess_History)</h3>
Number of simultaneously active sessions allows conclusions on system load.<br/>
                          Peak number of simultaneously active sessions can be the base for sizing of session-pools (e.g. for application server).<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT /*+ PARALLEL(s,4) DB-Tools Ramm: active sessions */
