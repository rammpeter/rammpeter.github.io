<h3>Unnecessary primary keys without referencing foreign keys</h3>
Primary key constraint including PK-index and PK-column may be obsolete and can be dropped if:<br/>
- Purpose of this primary key is only technical nature (not ensuring business-driven uniqueness)<br/>
- No foreign keys are referencing this primary key<br/>
- No access occurs by using the primary key index<br/>
<br/>
