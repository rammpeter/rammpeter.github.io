<h3>Ensure PCTFree >= 10</h3>
Ensure that indexes are used with PCTFree >= 10 (minimum from my experience).<br/>
  With PCTFree < 10 (especially = 0) problems with automatic balancing are expected, especially during insert of sorted data<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT /* DB-Tools Ramm Index-PCTFree */* FROM (
