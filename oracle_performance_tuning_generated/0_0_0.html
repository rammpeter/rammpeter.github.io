<h3>Check for PCTFree >= 10</h3>
0 or very small values of PCTFree for indices can lead to performance losses, especially when inserting sorted data.<br/>
It is recommended to have at least 10% free space in the index blocks to avoid frequent block splits.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT /* DB-Tools Ramm Index-PCTFree */* FROM (
