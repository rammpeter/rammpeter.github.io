<h3>Statements with parallel query but with not parallelized contents (evaluation of SGA)</h3>
If using parallelel query accidentally not parallelized accesses on large structures may dramatically increase runtime of statement.<br/>
Leading INDEX-RANGE-SCAN for cascading nested loop joins should be transferred to WITH â€¦ /*+ MATERIALIZE */ and selected in main statement in parallel.<br/>
Selection considers current SGA.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>WITH SQL_Plan AS (SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE MATERIALIZE */ Inst_ID, SQL_ID, Operation, Options, Object_Owner, Object_Name, Other_Tag FROM gv$SQL_Plan)
