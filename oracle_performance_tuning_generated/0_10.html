<h3>Relevance of access on migrated / chained rows compared to total amount of table access</h3>
Chained rows causes additional reads of rows in separate DB-blocks while accessing a record which is not completely contained in current block.<br/>
There are two types:<br/>
<br/>
1. true chained rows:<br/>
A record doesn't compeletely fit into one DB-block, the columns of the record are stored in several DB blocks.<br/>
Both the Full Scan and Index RowID scans read further linked DB blocks when accessing paged out columns in the linked blocks (incrementing of 'table fetch continued rows').<br/>
<br/>
2. migrated rows:<br/>
A record no longer fits into the current block, is completely migrated to another block, but its RowID still references the original block.<br/>
At full scan, the linked blocks are not read separately, but with multiblock-read as part of the full scan (no increment of 'table fetch continued rows').<br/>
At RowID access e.g. during index scan, the linked blocks are read by another access (with increment of 'table fetch continued rows').<br/>
<br/>
Chained rows are predominantly migrated rows (variant 2). Variant 1 only occurs if the size of a record is greater than the blocksize.<br/>
<br/>
Chained rows can be avoided by adjusting PCTFREE and reorganization of affected table.<br/>
