<h3>Excessive filtering after TABLE ACCESS BY ROWID due to weak index access criteria (AWR history)</h3>
INDEX RANGE SCAN with high number of rows returned and restrictive filter after TABLE ACCESS BY ROWID leads to unnecessary effort for table access before rejecting table records from result.<br/>
You should consider to expand index by filter criterias of table access to reduce number of TABLE ACCESS BY ROWID.<br/>
This selection evaluates the AWR history.<br/>
Result is sorted by time effort for operation TABLE ACCESS BY ROWID.<br/>
