<h3>Missing usage of bind variables: Detection by identical plan-hash-value</h3>
Usage of literals instead of bind variables with high number of different literals leads to high parse counts and flooding of SQL-Area in SGA.<br/>
You may reduce the problem by setting cursor_sharing != EXACT, but you still need large amount of SGA-memory to match your SQL with the corresponding SQL with replaced bind variables.<br/>
So strong suggestion is: Use bind variables!<br/>
