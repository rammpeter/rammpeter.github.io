<h3>Recommendations for index-compression, test by selectivity</h3>
Index-compression (COMPRESS) is usefull by reduction of physical footprint for OLTP-indexes with poor selectivity (column level).<br/>
  For poor selective indexes reduction of size by 1/4 to 1/3 is possible.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>WITH Segments AS (SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE MATERIALIZE */ Owner, Segment_Name, ROUND(SUM(bytes)/(1024*1024),1) MBytes FROM DBA_Segments WHERE Owner NOT IN (SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE */ UserName FROM All_Users WHERE Oracle_Maintained = 'Y') GROUP BY Owner, Segment_Name)
