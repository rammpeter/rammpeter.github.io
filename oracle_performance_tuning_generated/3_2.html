<h3>Identification of hot blocks in DB-cache: frequent access on small objects</h3>
Statements with frequent read blocks in DB-cache cause risk of 'cache buffers chains' latch waits.<br/>
This selection scans for objects with high block access rate compared to size of object.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE USE_HASH(o s) */ /* DB-Tools Ramm Hot-Blocks im DB-Cache */
