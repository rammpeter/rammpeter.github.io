<h3>Coverage of foreign-key relations by indexes (detection of potentially missing indexes)</h3>
Protection of colums with foreign key references by index can be necessary for:<br/>
- Ensure delete performance of referenced table (suppress FullTable-Scan)<br/>
- Supress lock propagation (shared lock on index instead of table)<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>WITH Constraints AS (SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE MATERIALIZE */ Owner, Table_Name, Constraint_name, Constraint_Type, r_Owner, r_Constraint_Name
