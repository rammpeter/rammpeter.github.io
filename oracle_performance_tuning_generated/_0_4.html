<h3>Possibly useful compression of tables</h3>
Table compression (COMPRESS FOR xxx) reduces I/O-effort by improvement of cache hit ratio.<br/>
                Decrease in size by 1/3 to 1/2 is possible.<br/>
                Min. 20% decrease of size and relevant I/O should exist to compensate CPU overhead of compression/decompression.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT /* Panorama-Tool Ramm */
