<h3>Candidates for DETERMINISTIC in user-defined PL/SQL functions</h3>
User-defined PL/SQL functions may be cached in session for subsequent calls with same parameters if they are declared as deterministic.<br/>
For functions without dependencies there is a high likelihood that they are deterministic.<br/>
This selection shows PL/SQL functions not declared as DETERMINISTIC and without any dependency other than sys.STANDARD.<br/>
In addition SQLs from SGA are shown which uses this function name in their SQL syntax.<br/>
<br/>
This check does not evaluate package functions, only standalone functions are considered.<br/>
