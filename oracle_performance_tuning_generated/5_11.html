<h3>Possibly missing guaranty of uniqueness by unique index or unique / primary key constraint</h3>
If an implicit expectation for uniqueness of a column exists, then this should be safeguarded by an unique index or unique constraint.<br/>
This list shows all all columns with unique values at the time of last analysis if neither unique index nor unique constraint exists for this column.<br/>
