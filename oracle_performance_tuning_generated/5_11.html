<h3>Possibly missing guaranty of uniqueness by unique index or unique / primary key constraint</h3>
If an implicit expectation for uniqueness of a column exists, then this should be safeguarded by an unique index or unique constraint.<br/>
This list shows all all columns used as access or filter predicates with unique values at the time of last analysis if neither unique index nor unique constraint exists for this column.<br/>
