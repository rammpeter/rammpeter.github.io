<h3>Possibly probematic NULL-handling in bind variables (:A1 IS NULL OR Column = :A1)</h3>
To disable filtering on a certain column with NULL as bound value you often find a syntax like:<br/>
<br/>
SELECT * FROM table WHERE (:A1 IS NULL OR column = :A1);<br/>
<br/>
There can be huge drawbacks if using such OR-conditions.<br/>
The optimizer calculates with a cardinality of 5% in this case and chooses a full table scan.<br/>
This may be suboptimal because a possibly existing index on that column will not be used and also partition pruning cannot be used if the table is partitioned by that column.<br/>
<br/>
There are several alternatives with working usage of indexing or partition pruning:<br/>
1. Use specific SQL syntax depending on the value of the bind variable and bind only the needed values.<br/>
<br/>
2. If the list ouf bound variables at execution time is fixed, place a dummy line in the SQL for the NULL case like "(1=1 OR 1=:A1)", otherwise "column = :A1" .<br/>
<br/>
3. Use SQL macros to get the according SQL syntax for the bound value.<br/>
<br/>
4. Use UNION ALL instead of OR. This executes the full scan only if the bound value is NULL and scans the index only if the bound value is not NULL.<br/>
