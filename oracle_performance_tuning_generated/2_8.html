<h3>Concurrency on memory, latches: Overview over usage of sequences</h3>
If sequences may be cached in application, next values must not be read from DB one by one.<br/>
                                                              This may reduce the number of roundtrips between application and database.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT /* DB-Tools Ramm  Overview usage of sequences */ *
