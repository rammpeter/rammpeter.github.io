<h3>Parallel Query: Degree of parallelism (number of attached PQ servers) higher than limit for single SQL execution</h3>
Number of avilable PQ servers is a limited resource, so default degree of parallelism is often to high for production use, especially on multi-core machines.<br/>
Overallocation of PQ servers may result in serial processing og other SQLs estimated to process in parallel.<pre style='background-color: #FFFFCC;'>SELECT Instance_Number, SQL_ID, MIN(Sample_Time) First_Occurrence, MAX(Sample_Time) Last_Occurrence,
