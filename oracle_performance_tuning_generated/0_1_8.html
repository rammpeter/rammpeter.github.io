<h3>Tables with single-column primary key constraint which is not referenced by any foreign key constraint</h3>
An ID-column with primary key constraint and related index may by unnecessary if primary key constraint is not referenced by any foreign key constraint.<br/>
Often this is the case if:<br/>
- there are multi-column unique constraints or unique indexes for transaction data, which may be used as alternative unique access criteria<br/>
- or there is no need for accessing single records<br/>
- the used frameworks don't require the existence of technical ID<br/>
