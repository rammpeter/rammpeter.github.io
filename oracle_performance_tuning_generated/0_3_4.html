<h3>Partitioning for expensive access filtered by columns with low number of distinct values</h3>
If expensive full table access is done with filter conditions than range or list partitioning by one or more of this filter conditions may significantly reduce runtime.<br/>
Especially with release 12.2 and above automatic list partitioning lets you easy handle the creation of needed partitions without operation effort.<br/>
Conditions for useful partitioning by these filters are:<br/>
- The potential partition key should significantly reduce the result (e.g. to less than 3/4 if used as filter condition)<br/>
- The resulting number of partitions should by manageable (Oracle's absolute maximum for partitions of a table is 1048575, but the optimal number is much smaller)<br/>
- The number of records in a partition should be high enough (e.g. more than 10000 .. 100000), otherwhise it could be more sufficient to use an index<br/>
- The filter condition should by deterministic (able to be used as partition criteria)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, only execution plans in SGA are considered because Oracle does not store access and filter predicates in AWR speichert (fixed with rel. 21.3).<br/>
