            <h2>Panorama for Oracle</h2>
            „Panorama” is my free tool for performance analysis and troubleshooting of Oracle databases.<br/>
            Completed over many years it contains solutions for analysis workflows based on practical experience.<br/>
            As a GUI-application it ensures quick reaction with predefined workflows instead off dealing by hand with lots of SQL scripts.
            <h3>What does it offer?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Support for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Performance-optimization of applications using Oracle databases</li>
                        <li>Analysis of runtimes and wait events, also back in history</li>
                        <li>Preparation of several Oracle database's internal information for easy evaluation</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>it focuses on usage by DBAs and also by software developers with less Oracle knowledge</li>
                <li>aims to many issues that are inadequately analyzed and presented by other existing tools such as Enterprise Manager</li>
                <li>Panorama only reads via SELECT-SQLs from database. No write access, structure change, compile etc. needed.</li>
                <li>Supports:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Oracle databases on standard hardware as well as RAC-systems and engineered systems (EXADATA)</li>
                        <li>Oracle database versions beginning with Oracle 10.2</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>Parts of Oracle's "Diagnostic Pack" are used for some functions of panorama, so licensing of this option is required for connected Oracle-DB</li>
                <li>Web browser to access Panorama-GUI</li>
                <li>Your Oracle-User used for login with Panorama requires the grant "SELECT ANY DICTIONARY"</li>
            </ul>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><a href="http://github.com/rammpeter/Panorama/blob/master/start_Panorama.sh" target="_blank">Here you can find a sample shell-script to start Panorama for Unix/Linux</a></li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Run demo installation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://panorama-ramm.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Run preinstalled Panorama at Heroku-cloud (requires connect to your Oracle-DB from internet for usage)</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to get help?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Look at the image slide show to to get some info about Panorama's features</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/rammpeter/Panorama/wiki" target="_blank">WIKI and FAQ (unforunately still under construction)</a></li>
                <li>Write a <a href="mailto:Peter@ramm-oberhermsdorf.de">mail</a> if nothing else helps or to report problems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What about security?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For production purposes you should run Panorama with SSL-encrypted web traffic (https). How to for embedded Winstone application server is described above.</li>
                <li>Your oracle password is stored encrypted in server memory and will be decrypted shortly only for the process of establishing connection to your target database.<br/>
                The key used for this encryption consists of a server key which is salted with a unique client key specific to your browser.<br/>
                This way only requests from your browser are able to reuse the stored connect info for reestablishing the database connection.</li>
                <li>If you retain your login info for further fast logins (checkbox 'Save logins' in statup dialog), this info is stored in local server file system completely encrypted the same way like passwords.</li>
                <li>You can customize the server key used for encryption by setting the environment variable $SECRET_KEY_BASE to value of your choice.<br/>
                    Every change of $SECRET_KEY_BASE at server site leads to invalidation of all stored connection info.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Panorama is an Ruby on Rails application that runs with JRuby. Web resources you can find here:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://github.com/rammpeter/Panorama_Gem" target="_blank">Source code</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://rawgit.com/rammpeter/Panorama_Gem/master/app/views/help/version_history.html" target="_blank">Version history</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you use tnsnames.ora for TNS name resolution it should be located at server site in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin or in a directory targeted by environment variable $TNS_ADMIN.</li>
                <li>Panorama starts multiple server instances in JRuby (default = 3).<br/>Each server instance hold it's own Oracle-connection to the last used database and reuses this open connection, if the next requests uses the same database connection info.<br/>
                If the next request uses another database, then the current connection is closed and opened with the new connection info.</li>
                <li>Panorama renders one single web page via Ajax-calls. This way the back button of your browser is not supported to return to former page content.</li>
                <li>Panorama writes short usage information to plain text file 'panorama_usage_info.log' in the directory targeted by $PANORAMA_VAR_HOME<br/>
                    You can view this log info via http://&lt;your server ip&gt;:8080/Panorama/usage/info
